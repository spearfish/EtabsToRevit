# Project Title

Export Etabs Excel file to Revit 

## Deployment

This is a Revit add-in which took a exported Etabs Excel file and read it to build structural framing and size it correctly. 

## Status of Project 

This project is no longer used.  We've found that we can achieve this much faster using a dynamo script written in Python.  The Dynamo script is actively being used on several projects.
